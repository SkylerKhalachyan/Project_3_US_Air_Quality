## Rationale
The study aims to analyze the trends in Air Quality Index (AQI) across the United States through a dashboard of visualizations. With increasing concern about the impact of air pollution on human health and the environment, understanding the patterns and changes in AQI is crucial for policy development and mitigation strategies. This study will facilitate informed ideas about the state of air quality, demonstrating state and city trends and geographical patterns between population density, air quality particulates, and AQI levels.
